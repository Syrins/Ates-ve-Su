Gameplay
The players are represented by two of the earth elements - water and fire; the elements are personified by the little water girl and a little fire boy. The players can control their characters by using the left and right arrow keys (to move left or right respectively), the up arrow key (to jump up), and the down arrow key (to jump down).

There are several obstacles; there are small mud pools that kill any of the characters if they fall or walk accidentally in them: The players must jump over them to avoid death and consequently losing the game. There are small pools containing either water or fire: the fire boy must jump over the water ponds but can walk through the fire puddle. The water girl must jump over the fire pools, however, she can safely walk through the small water pools. 
There are buttons that opens vertical gates and close horizontal bridges when pressed, the button must be pressed for the gate to continue being opened and for the bridge to continue being closed, once the button is released the gate or the bridge returns to their original state.


There are some enemies that aims to kill the fireboy and the watergirl. When the player come near the enemy, the enemy moves toward him/her in an attempt to kill the player. They player has to jump over the enemy to avoid being killed.

There are some stone boxes that can be pushed so that the players can use them to jump to areas that can’t be reached with their normal jump (the one that occurs by using the up arrow key). Each player collects diamonds through the game, and these diamonds are used to determine level scores. The game ends when each player reaches his/her respective gate.
